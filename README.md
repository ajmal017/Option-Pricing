# Option-Pricing
Implemented some modules aimed at pricing through Montecarlo's method some of the most popular types of exotic options (Asian options, Down-and-in Barrier options and Down-and-out options) where the payoff function makes it impossible for the BS equation to be solved analytically.
Some of the methods include: calculating implied volatility based on current European calls prices, estimating  drift and volatility under Brownian assumption based on historical data, getting data from yfinance to perform independent analysis.
